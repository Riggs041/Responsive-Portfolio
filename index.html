      <p>My name is Mike Riggs and I am currently enrolled in the coding bootcamp at the University of MN. I graduated from Tartan High school in 2006. After high school I attended the University of Wisconsin and obtained a bachelors degree in Business Management. I worked as an insurance sales manager for 5 years before making the decision to move into a career in computer coding.</p>

      <p>In my free time I enjoy traveling, playing hockey, softball and spending time on the lake. I rescued a 3 your old Husky named Simba. He is full of energy and loves to go on walks, sunbath on the deck and chase rabbits in the backyard.</p>
